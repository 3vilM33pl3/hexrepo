Hexcom is the client library which can be used to communicate with the [`hexcloud`](https://github.com/3vilM33pl3/hexcloud) backend.

# VCPKG

`vcpkg install grpc --triplet x64-windows`

`vcpkg install protobuf --triplet x64-windows`

`vcpkg install boost --triplet x64-windows`


## Compile
### Windows
Make sure your toolchain is configured for 64 bit builds.
### Dependencies
Install dependencies with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) manager:

    `vcpkg install grpc --triplet x64-windows`

`vcpkg install protobuf --triplet x64-windows`

`vcpkg install boost --triplet x64-windows`

#### Ninja (Optional but recommended)
Ninja dramatically accelerates building c++ programs. 

The easiest way to install Ninja is with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) the package manager for Windows.
After installing Chocolatey run this command in Powershell (run as Administrator):

    choco install ninja
    
Run CMake like this to enable Ninja:
```shell
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="cl.exe"
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="cl.exe"
      -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/local/boost_1_69_0    
```

#### gRPC
In case gRPC doesn't compile you possibly have to point to a valid root certificate. 
To do this set an environment variable pointing to the root certificate included in the project.
This roots.pem is a generic certificate file included with most browsers.      
```shell 
GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH=C:/Projects/hexcom/roots.pem
```      

#### install YASM (Optional)
The build is configured with ` set(OPENSSL_NO_ASM ON)` because the 64bit compile fails to compile the 
assembly code in boringssl. In case you want to enable ASM you will have to install YASM.

Installing [Yasm](https://yasm.tortall.net/) is needed so `boringssl` dependency can compile.
The easiest way to install is with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) the package manager for Windows.
After installing Chocolatey run this command in Powershell (run as Administrator):

    choco install yasm    

## MacOS


### Install tools
Install dependencies with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) manager. 
vcpkg can be installed with [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/): 

`brew install vcpkg`

### Install dependencies 
`vcpkg install protobuf cli boost-program-options`

### CMake flags
```shell
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$HOME/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

## Run
Without encryption on `localhost:8080`:
    `hexworld_client --nossl`
With encryption and specific server:
    `hexworld_client --address [address]`
